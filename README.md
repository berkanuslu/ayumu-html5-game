# Ayumu HTML5 based Memory Game
Ayumu is HTML5 based memory game which is written in pure Javascript without any library.

Ayumu, that is Japanese chimpanzee in the genus Pan, is a genius chimp, which can sort the numbers appear on the screen and disappeared in the 60 milliseconds.

Now, you can show that you are smarter than Ayumu by sorting numbers and letters! But, do not underestimate Ayumu! Even Ben Pridmore, the champion of 2004, 2008 and 2009 World Memory Championships, could not beat Ayumu!

You can improve your memory as you finish each level and finally you can reach at **Ayumu Level**!

Now, itâ€™s time to show your talent!

This project includes beginner level informations about HTML5 canvas basics and Javascript. I learnt HTML5 with this project and then I developed my master thesis project called [Dignity AI](https://github.com/berkanuslu/dignityai "Dignity AI"). I try to follow Linus Torvalds' Linux Kernel Coding Style and his advice. He said:

> Now, some people will claim that having 8-character indentations makes the code move too far to the right, and makes it hard to read on a 80-character terminal screen. The answer to that is that if you need more than 3 levels of indentation, you're screwed anyway, and should fix your program.

I hope you find something with reviewing my codes.
